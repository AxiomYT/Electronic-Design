# 70cm - 2M Diplexer

* Implements frequency-domain multiplexing. Two input ports (2M, 70CM) are multiplexed onto a third port (OUT)
* the signals on L and H can coexist on port S without interfering with each other.
* the signal on 2M Port will occupy the VHF Band and the signal on the 70CM will occupy the UHF band.
* the diplexer consists of a lowpass filter connecting 70CM Port and OUT 
* and a high pass filter connecting 2M Port and OUT.
